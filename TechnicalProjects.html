        <p style="color: whitesmoke;"> In my years in University and before, I have explored the worlds designed by engineers and computer wizards. I enjoyed the mathematical applications in the scientific and real world modeling realms as well as more interpersonal applications. I have gravitated to real world problems and utilizing my intuition with data to model and understand processes that elevate our world to one which we intermingle harmoniously with each other and the planet. A challenging problem to shift mindsets, but through my developments in consulting and research I have grown comfortable with looking at interpersonal and envirnmental system data. I hope to find a realm of industry and research where I can further these passions of mine and help spread the word motivating a better future.  </p>

        <h2>Bay Delta Network Anlysis</h2>
        <p1>
                        In this project, Alex Brown and I were inspired to research and develop for our class "Data Science for Urban Systems" taught by Dr. Marta Gonzalez throught the UC Berkeley department of Civil Engineering and City Planning. Throughout the course were were exposed to network analysis using python tools such as NetworkX and OSMNX as well as conduct geospatial analysis with census tracks in the United States. This project, linked below was inspired by the current and prospective funding from a California grant to the University of California to research the Bay Delta water system which is a network of levees, rivers, and other waterways which guide water from the Sierra Nevada Mountain range to California farmland and other destinations for fresh water. The current system is extremely stressed due to its overdue reformation and redevelopment needs. Current efforts are being ideaiated within the current government, but major changes need to take place in order to reduce the levee failures that lead to fresh water sources bleeding into the salty estuaries of the San Pablo and Suisun Bay. <br/> We first mapped each body of water as a node with geographic data, type of waterway and region within the delta system and used those that it runs into as their links. Then we conducted network anlysis populating a datatable with network statistics such as degree connectivity, degree centrality, and other NetworkX statistical properties one can pull. The relationships between geography and connectivity were interesting to me, so often analysis was conducted in the domain of geography. We futher did clustering analysis over multiple factor combinations from the statistics and other given information. <br/> A main goal is to identify ensemble levee failures given there is a large water event such as heavy rain storms or large spring melts from a deep snowpack. You will find the website below which has more information as well as the link to my github folder for this project.<br/>

        <h2>Soil Moisture Analysis in the Sierra Nevadas</h2>
        <p1>
                        Being that I am an avid skiier and very conscious about the affects of climate change on our mountain regions with respect to snow fall, rain on snow events, and other factors that may lead to detrimental events for our natural landscape, during the course: Time Series Analysis for Ecological and Environmental data I conducted the following research.<br/> I located and wrangled relational data sets I found that yielded information on weather patterns and snow depth at several locations in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Using various analysis methods, AB testing, descriptive statistic analysis, etc. I was able to refine my data to input it into a Mutlivariate Autoregressive Model using the R MARSS package. I had a timeframe of about 10 years including two El Nino years. El Nino is important to note as typically it is accompanied by warmer weather and more rain events. I thought that this was valuable to study as with the climate evolution, we are trending towards warmer weather which leads to less snow and more rain when we do have storms in the sierras. I was looking to analyze the covariate effects of snow pack, temperature and rainfall on soil moisture at several depths at a fixed location in the sierras. It was important to note that the data for soil moisture and snow, temperature and rain were collected at different locations, so a function would need to be applied to transform the data to the "same" domain. Below you will see a link to the presentation I gave, the journal entry I wrote as well as the github containing all my code and other important information and data. <br/>
